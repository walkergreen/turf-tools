"""Full-pipeline integration test.

Runs the same DAG `seed-persons` runs — `voter_file_loader` → `tiger` →
`osm` → `matching` → `geocode` → `assembly` → `aggregate` — against the
full NYC voter fixture (`ny-voters-2026-03-08-nyc.parquet`, ~5.4M
voters) in an isolated tempdir DuckLake.

Asserts:

  - Exact-match golden counts captured from a known-good run, so any
    behavior change (intentional or not) trips the test and forces an
    explicit re-baseline.
  - Strict structural invariants (every row keyed correctly, no NULL
    coords, no duplicate building dots, etc.) that should always hold
    regardless of the version baseline.

Marked `@pytest.mark.integration` so the default suite skips it
(see `pnpm data:test` vs `pnpm data:test:integration`).

Caches:
  - TIGER shapefiles under `apps/data/tiger_cache/` (~30 MB per county).
  - OSM PBF + buildings extract under `apps/data/osm_cache/` (~500 MB
    download on first run, then a cache hit).
