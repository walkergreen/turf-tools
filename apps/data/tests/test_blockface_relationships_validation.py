"""Ground-truth validation of the relationship derivation.

The unit tests prove the wedge code matches its own model; these tests
check the model against physical reality using data the derivation
never sees: the East Village sample cut
(``fixtures/sample-turf-east-village.json``), whose 2,160 buildings
were placed by the geocoding pipeline at physical offsets on the
correct side of each street.

Two independent checks:

1. **Side convention.** Buildings the geocoder assigned to
   ``<tlid>:left`` must sit geometrically left of the digitized TIGER
   line (cross-product sign in UTM). If the left/right-vs-digitization
   convention were inverted — the classic bug in this computation —
   agreement would be ~1%, not ~99%. (The residual mismatches are OSM
   complex-centroid placements that stray across the line.)

2. **Kind-vs-geometry separation.** For each derived relationship, the
   angle at the shared node between the two blockfaces' nearest
   buildings must order the way the physical corners do: hinge pairs
   (same corner) tightest, turns near 90°, continue/kitty-corner
   widest. A systematic wedge-assignment error (e.g. a broken
   digitization flip) would swap or blur hinge and kitty-corner.

Skips when the TIGER cache is cold, like the Manhattan golden test.
