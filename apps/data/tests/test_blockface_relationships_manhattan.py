"""Real-data test: relationship derivation on Manhattan TIGER, zip 10003.

Loads the cached Manhattan (county 061) TIGER shapefiles into an
isolated tempdir DuckLake and derives blockface relationships scoped to
zip 10003 (East Village). Golden counts captured 2026-07-03 against
TIGER 2024; re-baseline (with an explanation in the PR description)
when the crossing-cost table or classification rules intentionally
change.

Skips when the TIGER cache is cold so the default suite never hits the
network — run the full pipeline integration test (or `seed-persons`)
once to warm `apps/data/tiger_cache/`.

The whole module (load + two derivations + assertions) runs in a few
seconds; a hard 30s ceiling on the scoped derivation guards against
pathological regressions (e.g. accidentally classifying every node in
the county per zip).
