"""Load administrative boundary polygons into DuckLake.

A "boundary" is a polygon naming an administrative unit (Election
Districts, ZIP areas, Census tracts, …). All loaders write to the
same destination shape:

    ducklake.{schema}.{key_group}
        key   VARCHAR    -- unique id within the key group
        name  VARCHAR    -- nullable display label
        geom  GEOMETRY   -- polygon, pre-simplified for map rendering

Boundaries live in the org catalog (alongside `persons_geocoded`,
`buildings_geocoded`, etc.) rather than the geo catalog, because they're
derived from each org's voter scope — two orgs running `seed-boundaries`
with different fixtures produce different `nyc_eds` tables. The shared
TIGER reference data stays under `ducklake_geo.tiger.*`, and OSM under
`ducklake_geo.osm.*`.

Three loaders share that contract:

- `boundary_from_blocks` (preferred) — derive polygons from the voter
  file by unioning the TIGER census blocks that voters with each key
  live in. No external shapefile needed; polygons match the voter
  file by construction.
- `boundary_from_geojson` — read an external GeoJSON file/URL via
  `ST_Read`. Escape hatch for key groups without voter coverage.
- `boundary_from_table` — project from a table already in DuckLake
  (TIGER ZCTAs, tracts, …). Pure SQL, no file fetch.

Geometry is pre-simplified at `DEFAULT_SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE` (0.0001° ≈
11 m at the equator — invisible at city zoom but ~5× smaller file).

    """Derive per-key polygons from the voter file + TIGER census blocks.

    For each distinct key value, takes the set of blocks where any voter
    tagged with that key lives, unions them into a single polygon, and
    writes one row to ``{schema}.{key_group}``. No external
    boundary shapefile is involved; the polygon for ED 23-001 literally is
    the union of blocks containing voters with `precinct = '23-001'`. The
    polygon for ZIP 11211 is the union of blocks containing voters with
    `zip5 = '11211'` — which sidesteps the ZIP5/MODZCTA-shape mismatch
    that plagues external ZIP shapefiles.

    `key_expression` is a SQL fragment producing the key from a row in
    the geocoded persons table, e.g.:
      - ``"zip5"``                                                for ZIPs
      - ``"precinct"``                                            for AD-EDs

    Each block is assigned to *one* key — the key with the most voters
    in that block — so polygons partition cleanly instead of
    overlapping. Without majority assignment a block straddling two EDs
    (most blocks, since ED lines don't follow block edges) would land
    in both polygons. Ties broken by key ASC for stability.

    Spatial join uses distinct (key, lng, lat) tuples with voter
    counts collapsed in. Voters within a building share coordinates,
    so this drops ~5M voters down to ~600K building-key tuples on the
    NYC sample, ~10x speedup vs. joining one row per voter.

    Land blocks that contain no voters (parks, industrial parcels,
    cemetery blocks, etc.) are backfilled by nearest-neighbor: each
    unassigned land block inherits the key of the closest voter-
    assigned block by centroid distance. Without this, large
    no-voter blocks become visible holes in the polygon coverage,
    especially for ZIPs.

    Water-only blocks (``land_area = 0``) are excluded from
    backfilling so polygons don't extend across rivers, the harbor,
    Central Park's reservoir, etc.

    Tabblock rows are filtered to this dataset version's resolved scope
    (`geo_scope`, the (state, county) pairs it was geocoded against) on
    read: the shared tabblock table is an accumulating download cache and
    may hold counties from previous, wider imports. Without the filter,
    every out-of-scope land block backfills onto the nearest in-scope
    key, ballooning edge keys far beyond the voter file's footprint.
