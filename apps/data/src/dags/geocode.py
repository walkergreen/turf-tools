"""Assign lat/lon coordinates to voters.

Takes voters from `matching.py` (`persons_best_match`) and OSM building
data from `osm.py` (`osm_building_lookup`) and produces a per-voter
position. Two mutually-exclusive paths; `assembly.py` unions them.

- `refined_positions` — for TIGER-matched voters. Project the OSM
  building centroid onto the matched blockface (or use the OSM
  centroid directly when the projection clamps or the building sits
  inside a residential complex).

- `osm_only_matches` — for TIGER-miss voters. Look the voter up
  directly in OSM and snap them to the nearest blockface in their zip
  for downstream grouping.

`position_source` values, in priority order:

  - `osm_matched`     — TIGER + OSM, projected onto the matched blockface
  - `osm_complex`     — OSM centroid (voter inside a residential complex)
  - `osm_off_segment` — OSM centroid (projection clamps off the matched blockface)
  - `tiger_only`      — TIGER blockface, rank-based fallback (no OSM)
  - `osm_only`        — TIGER-miss voter rescued via direct OSM lookup

    Position rule:
      1. Match the voter to an OSM address by exact
         `(zip5, canonical_key, housenumber)`. Pick the way variant
         over a node variant when both exist (way = building polygon
         centroid; node = doorway).
      2. If matched AND the building centroid is inside an OSM
         `landuse=residential` polygon (large residential complexes
         where individual buildings sit well off any road), use the
         OSM centroid directly — no road projection, no perpendicular
         offset.
      3. Else if matched AND the OSM centroid projects strictly onto
         the matched TIGER blockface (`osm_frac ∈ (0, 1)`):
         `fraction = ST_LineLocatePoint(blockface, OSM)` projects the
         OSM-known building centroid onto the TIGER blockface for an
         along-road position.
      4. Else if matched but the projection *clamps*
         (`osm_frac = 0.0 or 1.0` — the OSM building is geometrically
         beyond the blockface's endpoints, typically because TIGER's
         address range exceeds its physical geometry): use the OSM
         centroid directly. This avoids snapping voters to the wrong
         end of a too-short blockface.
      5. Else (no OSM match): `fraction = rank / (max_rank + 1)` via
         DENSE_RANK ordering by (prefix, housenumber, half_code) —
         the original TIGER linear-ramp behavior.
      6. Road-projected positions (cases 3 and 5) get a perpendicular
         offset (`ROAD_OFFSET_M`) and a 1D shove so distinct buildings
         stay ≥ `MIN_BUILDING_SPACING_M` apart.

    `position_source` is one of:
      - `osm_complex`     — OSM centroid, inside a residential complex
      - `osm_matched`     — fraction from OSM projection onto the blockface
      - `osm_off_segment` — OSM centroid (projection clamped on matched blockface)
      - `tiger_only`      — fraction from DENSE_RANK fallback

    `osm_street` is carried through so `canonical_addresses` can pick
    OSM's per-building canonical name (more stable than TIGER's, which
    has aliases for the same physical street).

    Non-incremental: drops + recreates every run. DENSE_RANK is a
    window over the full blockface, so new voters would shift everyone
    else's rank.

    `osm_building_lookup` to find their building, then snap to the

    the building isn't directly on a street (residential complexes
