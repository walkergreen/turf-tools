"""Version-level derived metadata — properties computed once from a dataset
version's data at import time and cached on `dataset_versions.derived_metadata`
(Postgres), so reads never recompute them over the immutable version's rows.

Computed here (data already hot post-import) and written by `finalize_version`;
the web reads the blob straight from Postgres, like it reads the manifest. Add a
new derived property by extending `compute_derived_metadata`.
