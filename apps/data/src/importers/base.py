"""The importer contract + the field manifest model.

The `Manifest` is the per-dataset-version field catalog. It replaces the
hardcoded, web/data-duplicated catalogs — `apps/web/src/lib/filters.ts`
(`FILTER_SECTIONS`/`FilterDef`) and this package's former `dsl/criteria.py`
`FIELDS` + `KEY_GROUPS` — with one structure both sides consume: the web fetches
it to render the segment/zone editors, the data server reads it to compile SQL.

Scope principle: **fields become data, kinds stay code.** The *set* of filter
kinds (below) and their per-kind logic (how each renders an input / compiles to
SQL) stay hardcoded — parallel code in TS + Python, since they're the wire
contract + behaviour. Only the *field list* becomes per-version data. Adding a
field is free manifest data; adding a kind is the expensive cross-language change.
