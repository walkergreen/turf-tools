"""Curated voter-file transformation queries.

Each transformation maps a state/source-specific raw voter-file schema onto
the `Person` required core (see `src/models.py`) plus the dataset's filterable
fields. State-specific raw codes are normalized to canonical cross-state labels
via the maps defined in this module.

Every field — the Person core and each filterable extra (enrollment, dates,
districts, …) — is a typed top-level column; the importer's manifest describes
which are filterable. There is no catch-all JSON blob.
